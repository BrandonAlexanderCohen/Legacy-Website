      <h2>About Legacy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What is Legacy?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="answer">Legacy is an Arthurian Fantasy about two princes who try to live up to the legacy made by those before them despite their lack of self confidence and desire. Vance, the oldest, is going to be announced as heir to the thrown in seven days and he has it in his mind that he will not be able to pull Excalibur from the stone; a tradition that means he will be a great and just king like those before him. Alex, the youngest, is uninterested in anything involving the workings of the kingdom, but the powers of sorcery are welling up inside of him. Merlin, the only sorcerer allowed as a resident in Camelot, has taken an interest. Meanwhile, unknown to the royal family, something insidious is being planned in the castle by a mysterious figure that hides in the shadows.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> How long has this project been in the works?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="answer">The project started as an untitled feature length script by writers Brandon and Nick in 2012. After several drafts, in 2014 the two decided to bring down their hopes of selling a feature length fantasy script to the ambition of making their script into an animated webseries. Alana, who had been a test reader up until that point, officially joined the group to assist with the concept and add content and more in-depth assistance. In autumn, 2014, Ana joined the group as the artist. As concept art and episode scripts were popping out, in early 2015 it was discovered that the four’s endeavor for a webseries was beyond their starting budget and out of their skill range. Unwilling to give up, they are now determined to present this story, now named Legacy, to the masses as a virtual comic.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When do you plan to launch the project?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="answer">Our goal is the officially launch Summer 2015.</p>
      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Who are we?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="answer">Our group consists of Nick Hernandez, Ana Chavarro, Alana Drucker, and Brandon Cohen. We are a group of friends living in Central Florida.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>What are we doing?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="answer">We are piling our talents together to make our first virtual comic.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why a virtual comic?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="answer">There has been much consideration for what our format should be to present our story. As our group grew to the four of us, we pooled all our talents together and we agreed that an online comic would be the best format for us to tell our story for the world.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why this story?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="answer">We started this story as a response to Disney’s The Sorcerer’s Apprentice (2010). All of us are fans of Disney and though we felt the movie had some inspired moments, a lot of it fell flat on what could have been a great adaption of the short. We have deviated quite a bit from that response as we made the story our own but there are still remnants of the Disney inspiration there.</p>
